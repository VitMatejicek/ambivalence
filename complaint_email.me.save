\fBSubject: Lenovo Ideapad 720-IKB Purchase Complaint\f[]

Dear Lenovo Customer Service,

.pp
I have recently purchased a Lenovo Ideapad 720-IKB laptop from one of your
official resellers and I am having some issues with it. I have been 



I am writing to express my discontent with the state of the Lenovo
Ideapad 720-IKB product I received from one of your official resellers.
I have been a loyal Lenovo customer for many years and, needless to say,
I am unhappy I have to complain about Lenovo products.
.pp
The first issue I have encountered with the laptop was revealed shortly
after the device was turned on for the very first time.
When the system was subject to moderate to heavy load,
the keyboard would start to lag heavily, sometimes incorrectly reporting input even
ten seconds after the key was lifted.
This issue was system-wide, not limited to specific programs, which is indicative of
a manufacturer origin, rather than being caused by something I had done.
.pp
After a short exchange with the support team, I have managed to locate the underlying
cause, which was the Lenovo Utility program. I find the possibility of such a glaring bug
bypassing your Q&A tests very peculiar, to say the least.
.pp
Of course, disabling this background process was an effortless solution to this problem
and is thus not worth being mentioned by itself, it serves, however, as the tip of
the iceberg of the problems I have encountered with this unit.
.pp
After resolving the aforementioned issue, I continued my inspection of the device with a
partial disassembly.
Regrettably, just the removal of the bottom plate led me to further doubt the quality of
the product. The copper inside of the plate was covered with black fingerprints.
.pp
Furthermore, the cables on the motherboard were not folded properly at all.
Several were at a risk of breaking and needed to be repositioned to prevent the chance of damage.
It stands to reason that the common user would never inspect the insides of the laptop and would
carry on using a device with a significantly reduced durability.
.pp
Even worse, removing the heatsink from the GPU and the CPU revealed that the thermal compound did
not cover the entire GPU die, which meant that the cooling system had a reduced thermal conductivity,
therefore leading to performance throttling due to high temperatures.
.pp
All of the issues mentioned above lead me to believe that the device I have received is, in fact,
a refurbished unit, not a newly assembled product. If that is indeed the case, I would like to ask for a compensation in form of one of the following three:
.(l
1. Return of the product and reimbursement. This would not be my preferred option,
    as I have already spent a considerable amount of time rectifying the issues this laptop has had.
2. Extension of warranty, in case any undiscovered manufacturing issue causes damage.
3. Partial reimbursement, as no one should be paying the full price for a refurbished unit.

.pp
I am attaching all the documents regarding the purchase of the product and
photographs as proof of the issues. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours truly,
Lukáš Hozda
